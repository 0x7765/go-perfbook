This is a work-in-progress book in Go performance.

There are different ways to contribute:

   1) add to or summarizes the resources in TODO
   2) add bullet points or new topics to be covered
   3) write prose and flesh  out the sections in the book

Eventually sample programs to optimize and exercises will be needed (maybe).

Coordination will be done in the #performance channel on the Gophers slack.
